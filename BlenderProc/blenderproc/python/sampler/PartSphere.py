    :param radius: The radius of the sphere.
    :param mode: Mode of sampling. Determines the geometrical structure used for sampling. Available: SURFACE (sampling
                 from the 2-sphere), INTERIOR (sampling from the 3-ball).
    :param dist_above_center: The distance above the center, which should be used. Default: 0.0 (half of the sphere).
    :param part_sphere_dir_vector: The direction in which the sphere should be split, the end point of the vector,
                                   will be in the middle of the sphere pointing towards the middle of the
                                   resulting surface. Default: [0, 0, 1].
    :return: A random point lying inside or on the surface of a solid sphere.
