"""
This file provides to functions to first set up the lens distortion used in this particular BlenderProc
run and then to apply the said lens distortion parameters to an image rendered by Blender. Both functions must be
called after each other to use the lens distortion feature correctly. The `set_lens_distortion` fct. has to be
called before the rendering takes place and the `apply_lens_distortion` has to be applied to the rendered images.

For more information on lens distortion see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion_(optics)
Note that, unlike in that wikipedia entry as of early 2021, we're here using the undistorted-to-distorted formulation.

    This function applies the lens distortion parameters to obtain an distorted-to-undistorted mapping for all
    natural pixels coordinates of the goal distorted image into the real pixel coordinates of the undistorted
    Blender image. Since such a mapping usually yields void image areas, this function suggests a different
    (usually higher) image resolution for the generated Blender image. Eventually, the function
    `apply_lens_distortion` will make us of this image to fill in the goal distorted image with valid color
    values by interpolation. Note that when adapting the internal image resolution demanded from Blender, the
    camera main point (cx,cy) of the K intrinsic matrix is (internally and temporarily) shifted.

    This function has to be used together with bproc.postprocessing.apply_lens_distortion(), else only the
    resolution is increased but the image(s) will not be distorted.

    :param k1: First radial distortion parameter (of 3rd degree in radial distance) as defined
            by the undistorted-to-distorted Brown-Conrady lens distortion model, which is conform to
            the current DLR CalLab/OpenCV/Bouguet/Kalibr implementations.
            Note that undistorted-to-distorted means that the distortion parameters are multiplied
            by undistorted, normalized camera projections to yield distorted projections, that are in
            turn digitized by the intrinsic camera matrix.
    :param k2: Second radial distortion parameter (of 5th degree in radial distance) as defined
            by the undistorted-to-distorted Brown-Conrady lens distortion model, which is conform
            to the current DLR CalLab/OpenCV/Bouguet/Kalibr implementations.
    :param k3: Third radial distortion parameter (of 7th degree in radial distance) as defined
            by the undistorted-to-distorted Brown-Conrady lens distortion model, which is conform to
            the current DLR CalLab/OpenCV/Bouguet/Kalibr implementations.
            The use of this parameter is discouraged unless the angular field of view is too high,
            rendering it necessary, and the parameter allows for a distorted projection in the whole
            sensor size (which isn't always given by features-driven camera calibration).
    :param p1: First decentering distortion parameter as defined by the undistorted-to-distorted
            Brown-Conrady lens distortion model in (Brown, 1965; Brown, 1971; Weng et al., 1992) and is
            comform to the current DLR CalLab implementation. Note that OpenCV/Bouguet/Kalibr permute them.
            This parameter shares one degree of freedom (j1) with p2; as a consequence, either both
            parameters are given or none. The use of these parameters is discouraged since either current
            cameras do not need them or their potential accuracy gain is negligible w.r.t. image processing.
