class GlobalStorage:
    """
    The GlobalStorage has two functions:
        1. It can store data over the boundaries of modules with the add(), set() and get() functions
        2. It keeps a global config, which can be used as a fallback strategy in the case a config value is used
           in many modules, for example the "output_dir".

    To 1. you can save your own keys in the GlobalStorage to access them in a later module.
        For example you have a personal renderer or loader, which has attributes, which are independent of the scene and
        the objects so custom properties for those are not the way to go. In these instances you can use these 
        functions.

    Here is a list of all used global_storage_keys to avoid that your key is clashing with existing keys:

    .. list-table:: 
        :widths: 25 100 10
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Parameter
          - Description
          - Type
        * - renderer_distance_end
          - This key is saved by the Renderer during distance rendering and is used in the
            StereoGlobalMatchingWriter. 
          - string
         
    Please add all new keys you create to this list.
    
    To 2. the global config is inited during the main.Initializer module, this means before that it is not possible to
    access keys from the global config, but it is possible to add keys, which can then be later accessed for that check:
    add_to_config_before_init(). It is usually not necessary that you will access the global config yourself as each
    Config checks automatically if the key is stored in the global config, if it was not defined in the current module.
    The checking order:
    Local module then the global config if both fail the default value is used, if there is none an Exception is thrown.
