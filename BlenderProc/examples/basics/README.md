# Basic Examples overview

The following examples will guide you through core functionality of BlenderProc. We recommend starting with them.

* [basic example](basic/README.md): Introduction. How to run a pipeline, and how, why and when certain things happen when running one.
* [camera_sampling](camera_sampling/README.md): Sampling of different camera positions inside of a shape with constraints for the rotation.
* [light_sampling](light_sampling/README.md): Sampling of light poses inside of a geometrical shape.
* [entity_manipulation](entity_manipulation/README.md): Changing various parameters of entities via selecting them in the config file.
* [material_manipulation](material_manipulation/README.md): Material selecting and manipulation.
* [physics_positioning](physics_positioning/README.md): Enabling simple simulated physical interactions between objects in the scene. 
* [semantic_segmentation](semantic_segmentation/README.md): Generating semantic segmentation labels for a given scene.
* [camera_object_pose](camera_object_pose/README.md): Load and render models given the intrinsics and extrinsics.
